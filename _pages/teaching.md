### Lectures

I am in charge of the MSc level module on *Introduction to Statistical Data Science* (STAT0032) which will take place in autumn 2019 at UCL. Lectures are 9-11 on Mondays and tutorials 11-12 on Fridays in weeks 5-10 and 12-16.  For further details on the course, see the corresponding Moodle page. 

On top of that, I also teach tutorials for the term 1 module STAT0005 *Probability & Inference* for second and third year undergraduates.

## About

Whether for computing an integral, solving an optimisation problem, or solving differential equations, numerical methods are one of the core tools of statistics and machine learning.


Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods, a set of tools which aim to solve problems from numerical analysis using Bayesian inference.
These algorithms are particularly useful for statistical applications since they allow for both the inference and the numerics to speak the same language, and as such uncertainty can be propagated throughout the entire procedure.

Bayesian quadrature, the equivalent of the well-known Bayesian optimisation problem which focuses on tackling the computation of intractable integrals.

## MSc and PhD Students

I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take up the supervision or co-supervision of MSc and PhD students. I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL or the Turing Institute.

Funding for PhD students is available through several routes, including the [*UCL Statistical Science department fund*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd), the [UCL centre for doctoral training in *Foundations of AI*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/research-degree-foundational-artificial-intelligence), the [UCL centre for doctoral training in *Financial Computing and Data Science*](https://financialcomputing.org/), and the [UCL centre for doctoral training in *Data Intensive Science*](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/).

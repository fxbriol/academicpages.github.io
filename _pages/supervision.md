I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take up the supervision of MSc and PhD students. I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL or the Turing Institute. 

## PhD Students

See below for important information and useful resources if you are thinking of applying.

**Before Applying** When getting in touch, please make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own based on my recent publications. 

**Application Process** After our initial discussion you might be interested to get details on the application process for PhDs at UCL. For this, please have a look at [the UCL graduate study guide](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/applying-graduate-study/what-you-need-complete-application) on this process. You can also find tips on writing a convincing research statement on [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/sites/prospective-students_graduate/files/potential-supervisor.pdf).

**Funding** Funding for international and UK-EU students is available through several routes. The main avenues are the [*UCL Statistical Science department*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd) funds, the [CDT in *Foundations of AI*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/research-degree-foundational-artificial-intelligence) and the [NERC London DTP](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/). Other possible funding routes include the [CDT in *Financial Computing and Data Science*](https://financialcomputing.org/), the [CDT in *Data Intensive Science*](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) and the [Health Data Research UK/Turing PhD programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/?_cldee=ci5jaGFuZGxlckB1Y2wuYWMudWs%3d&recipientid=contact-243cf3cbd2a9e711810970106faa95f1-cd798151ea1648d0a88aaf88b8173974&esid=83591eb5-de0a-ea11-a811-002248070f4c).

Several schemes independent of UCL may also be of interest. A list of possible options is provided [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/funding-students-postgraduate-research-courses#charities), and the [following tool](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder) may be of help when searching for a scholarship you are eligible for. Depending on your country of origion, you may also be eligible for a [fee partnership from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/fee-partnerships). Finally, one other option is the commonwealth PhD scholarships; see [this page](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/) or [this page](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/)).


## MSc Students

At UCL, I supervise MSc students through the MSc Statistics, MSc Data Science and MSc Computational Statistics and Data Science programmes. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects which align with my research. Unfortunately I am not able to supervise any other MSc projects at this time (whether at UCL or not).

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.

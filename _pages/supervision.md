### Masters and PhD students

I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take up the supervision or co-supervision of MSc and PhD students. Unfortunately, I do not tend to take on students for internships or summer projects. I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL or the Turing Institute. When contacting me, please tell me what you are interested in doing, why you think I would be a suitable supervisor, and attach a copy of your CV and transcript.

#### Current students

* **George Wynne**, PhD student in Statistics at Imperial College London, Department of Mathematics. Co-supervised with Dr. Andrew Duncan and Prof. Mark Girolami since September 2018.

### Postdoctoral Researchers

Although I do not have any positions open at the moment, I enticipate this to change in the near future. Feel free to contact me by email about opportunities, including your CV and a range of topics you would be interested in working in.

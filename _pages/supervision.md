I enjoy supervising research projects and regularly take up the supervision of MSc and PhD students. I am particularly interested in hearing from potential PhD students with a strong mathematical background and/or strong programming abilities. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to contact me by email to discuss opportunities at UCL or the Turing Institute. 

## PhD Students

**Before Applying:** Please contact me via email before submitting a formal application. When getting in touch, make sure to highlight your research interests and how these align with my own. I usually get a high number of applicants, and a good way to show your are motivated to work with me is to demonstrate that you have done your research by, for example, having read some of my research papers in detail.

**Application Process:** I can supervise PhD students at UCL through a number of routes (each providing funding for UK and international students), including:
* The [*UCL Statistical Science*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/prospective-postgraduates/phd) department PhD programme. 
* The [centre for doctoral training (CDT) in *Foundations of AI*](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/study/research-degree-foundational-artificial-intelligence).
* The [London NERC doctoral training partnership (DTP)](https://london-nerc-dtp.org/). This PhD programme is a joint programme across a number of London institutions, and is appropriate if you are interested in a project at the intersection of statistics/machine learning and the environmental sciences. For this particular programme, you first need to be admitted to the NERC DTP (a process I am not involved with), and can contact me during your first year at the point where you are looking for a supervisor.

You can find more details on the application process for PhDs at UCL through [the UCL graduate study guide](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/applying-graduate-study/what-you-need-complete-application). You can also find tips on writing a convincing research statement on [this page](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/sites/prospective-students_graduate/files/potential-supervisor.pdf).

**Alternative Funding Routes:**  

Other possible routes at UCL include the [CDT in *Financial Computing and Data Science*](https://financialcomputing.org/), the [CDT in *Data Intensive Science*](https://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/cdt-dis/) and the [Health Data Research UK/Turing PhD programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/?_cldee=ci5jaGFuZGxlckB1Y2wuYWMudWs%3d&recipientid=contact-243cf3cbd2a9e711810970106faa95f1-cd798151ea1648d0a88aaf88b8173974&esid=83591eb5-de0a-ea11-a811-002248070f4c). Several schemes independent of UCL may also be of interest. A list of possible options is provided [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/funding-students-postgraduate-research-courses#charities), and the [following tool](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder) may be of help when searching for a scholarship you are eligible for. Depending on your country of origion, you may also be eligible for a [fee partnership from UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/fee-partnerships). Finally, one other option is the commonwealth PhD scholarships for ["high-income countries"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-high-income-countries/) or ["least developed countries and fragile states"](http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/apply/phd-scholarships-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states/)).


## MSc Students

At UCL, I supervise MSc students through the MSc Statistics, MSc Data Science and MSc Computational Statistics and Data Science programmes. If you are currently enrolled in one of these programmes, feel free to contact me about research projects which align with my research. Unfortunately I am not able to supervise any other MSc projects at this time (whether at UCL or not).

## Postdoctoral Researchers

I do not currently hold any funding for postdoctoral researchers, but would be happy to hear from anyone interested in joining my group and/or supporting strong candidates for external funding applications.

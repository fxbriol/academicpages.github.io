## Current Students

I am currently supervising the following great team of PhD students:

* [**Oscar Key**](https://oscarkey.github.io), PhD student within the CDT in Foundational AI at UCL, Department of Computer Science (since September 2020). *Main supervisor*. Second supervisor: Prof. Marc Deisenroth. *Project*: Robustness of Gaussian processes

* **Kaiyu Li**, PhD student in Statistics at UCL, Department of Statistical Science (since December 2019). *Second supervisor*. First supervisor: Prof. Serge Guillas. *Project*: Bayesian quadrature and multi-level Monte Carlo. 

* [**Zhuo Sun**](https://jz-fun.github.io), PhD student in Statistics at UCL, Department of Statistical Science (since May 2020). *Second supervisor*. First supervisor: Dr. Jinghao Xue. *Project*: Control Variates for Monte Carlo Methods.

I also have honorary PhD students i.e. PhD students with which I work with regularly and mentor, but that are not based at UCL:

* [**George Wynne**](https://georgewynne.github.io/), PhD student in Mathematics at Imperial College London, Department of Mathematics (since September 2018). Co-supervised with Dr. Andrew Duncan (Imperial) and Prof. Mark Girolami (Cambridge). *Project*: Theory for Gaussian processes.

* [**Takuo Matsubara**](https://sites.google.com/view/takuomatsubara/home), PhD student in Statistics at Newcastle University and The Alan Turing Institute (since September 2019). Main supervisor: Prof. Chris J. Oates (Newcastle). *Projects*: Bayesian neural networks and Stein discrepancies.


## Past Students doing Research

I have previously supervised a number of students currently doing research:

* [***Johanna Meier***](https://de.linkedin.com/in/johanna-meier-3737a6195), MSc Data Science thesis (UCL, 2020), title: "Scalable Inference for Generative
Models using Quasi-Monte Carlo". Now PhD student at Leibniz Universitat Hannover under the supervision of Prof. Philipp Sibbertsen.
* [**Charline le Lan**](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/lelan/), MSc Statistics thesis (Imperial College London, 2018), title: "Neural Networks for Variance Reduction in MCMC". Now PhD student at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Prof. Yee Whye Teh. 
* [**Xiaoyue Xi**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoyue_Xi), MSc Statistics thesis (Imperial College London, 2017), title: "Bayesian Monte Carlo in Computer Graphics". Received best MSc thesis award. Now PhD student at Imperial College under the supervision of Dr. Oliver Ratmann.

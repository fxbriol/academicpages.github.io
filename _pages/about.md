I am a research associate at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Engineering where I work on the EPSRC funded [MURI project](http://vision.jhu.edu/infopursuit/) on "Semantic Information Pursuit for Multimodal Data Analysis". I am also a visiting researcher at The Alan Turing Institute, where I work on projects relating to the [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). Prior to this, I was based in the Department of Mathematics at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/), and before that I was a PhD student on the joint centre for doctoral training in Statistical Science led by the universities of Warwick and Oxford.

My current research interests are at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular, I work on methodology for statistical computation and inference for large scale probabilistic models and use a variety of tools to solve these problems including kernel methods, stochastic process theory, Stein's method and Monte Carlo methods. 

For more details on my research, see my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/papers/) page or my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en), or try to catch me at one of my [presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/). For supervision opportunities, see also [this page](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/).

### News

* My paper on "Probabilistic Integration: A Role in Statistical Computation?" has been accepted for publication at Statistical Science and will appear together with invited discussions (all available [here](https://www.imstat.org/journals-and-publications/statistical-science/statistical-science-future-papers/)) from leading researchers in statistics, as well as a [rejoinder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10275). 

* I am co-organising an [ICML workshop](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?type=Workshop) on "Stein's method in Machine Learning and Statistics" with Lester Mackey, Chris Oates, Qiang Liu and Larry Goldstein. The workshop will bring together experts in Stein's method and researchers in machine learning and statistics to explore applications of the method in those fields. More details to come soon!

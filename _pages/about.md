## About

I am a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor) in the Department of Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/). I am also a Group Leader at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI, where I am affiliated to the [Data-Centric Engineering programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering#introduction). There, I lead research on the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/fundamentals-statistical-machine-learning) with an emphasis on methodology for complex engineering models.

My research interests are at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. I work on methodology for statistical computation and inference for large scale and computationally expensive probabilistic models. In particular, I am interested in the development of algorithms for numerical integration and sampling, as well as methodology for inference with intractable models. In my research, I like to use a variety of tools including kernel methods, Monte Carlo methods, stochastic process theory and Stein's method. 

Prior to UCL, I was a PhD student on the joint centre for doctoral training between the Departments of Statistics at Warwick and Oxford, then spent a year first as research assistant in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, then as a research associate in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge.

Alternatively, you can catch me at one of my [Presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/). For supervision opportunities, see also [this page](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/).



## News

* I will be giving an invited (virtual) talk as part of the j-ISBA series on [***Junior Bayes Beyond Borders (JB^3)***](https://www.bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Cdr/Bayeslab/Home/Webinar+series/).

* I have been awarded an [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/blog/recipients-of-the-2019-amazon-research-awards-announced) by Amazon Science for a project on *"Transfer Learning for Numerical Integration in Expensive Machine Learning Systems"*. 

* I am now research group lead for [Data Science Methodology for Weather and Climate](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/methodology-weather-and-climate), which is part of the new Met Office Academic Partnership with UCL.

* I have two new papers on doing inference for intractable model. The first paper, called [Minimum Stein Discrepancy Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08283), is a very flexible framework to do inference for models with unnormalised likelihoods which is grounded in Stein's method and can recover many existing methods, such as score-matching and contrastive divergence, as special cases. See the following [talk](https://slideslive.com/38917866/minimun-stein-discrepancy-estimators) for more details. The second, called [Statistical Inference for Generative Models with Maximum Mean Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05944) considers the problem of inference for generative models, and studies the flexibility afforded by the choice of reproducing kernel.

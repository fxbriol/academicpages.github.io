I am a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor) in the Department of Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), and a Visiting Researcher at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI, where I am affiliated to the Data-Centric Engineering programme.

My research interests are at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. I work on methodology for statistical computation and inference for large scale and computationally expensive probabilistic models. In particular, I am interested in the development of algorithms for numerical integration and sampling, as well as methodology for inference with intractable models. In my research, I like to use a variety of tools including kernel methods, Monte Carlo methods, stochastic process theory and Stein's method. 

Prior to UCL, I was a PhD student on the joint centre for doctoral training between Warwick and Oxford, then spent a year first as research assistant in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, then as a research associate in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. 

For more details on my research, see my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/papers/) page or my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en). Alternatively, you can catch me at one of my [presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/). For supervision opportunities, see also [this page](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/).



### News

* I have two new papers on doing inference for intractable model. The first paper, called [Minimum Stein Discrepancy Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08283), is a very flexible framework to do inference for models with unnormalised likelihoods which is grounded in Stein's method and can recover many existing methods, such as score-matching and contrastive divergence, as special cases. See the following [talk](https://slideslive.com/38917866/minimun-stein-discrepancy-estimators) for more details. The second, called [Statistical Inference for Generative Models with Maximum Mean Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05944) considers the problem of inference for generative models, and studies the flexibility afforded by the choice of reproducing kernel.

* Our paper on "Probabilistic Integration: A Role in Statistical Computation?" has been accepted for [publication in Statistical Science](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056025) and will appear together with invited discussions from leading researchers in statistics, as well as a [rejoinder](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056029). There are three discussion pieces by (i) [Fred Hickernel and R. Jagadeeswaran](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056026), (ii) [Art Owen](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056027), and (iii) [Michael Stein and Ying Hung](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056028).

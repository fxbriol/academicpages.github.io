### About

I am currently a fourth year PhD student supervised by [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.girolami) and am part of a joint PhD program between the Department of Statistics at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/) and the Department of Statistics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) called the Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme (OxWaSP). Since September 2016, I also have a visiting position in the Statistics Section at the Department of Mathematics at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/) and at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as part of their programme on [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/programme-data-centric-engineering).

My main research interests are at the interface of Computational Statistics, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. In particular, I have been working on:

* **Bayesian Probabilistic Numerical Methods**: I am interested in developing algorithms which solve problems from the field of numerical analysis using Bayesian inference methods. My work has focused particularly on Bayesian Quadrature, a method for numerical integration. I am part of the [SAMSI Working Group on Probabilistic Numerics](http://oates.work/samsi/) and one of the organisers of the regular online talks series.

* **Monte Carlo Methods**: I am interested in analysing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and variance reduction methods for related Monte Carlo estimators, specifically control variates and control functionals.

* **Stein's Method and Kernels**: Recent work has shown the benefits of combining [Stein's method](https://sites.google.com/site/steinsmethod/home) with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in order to obtain tractable divergences between probability measures. This can be a useful tool for developing methods in computational statistics such as control variates, samplers and statistical estimators.  

For more details on my research, see my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/publications/) page or my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en), or try to catch me at one of my [talks](https://fxbriol.github.io/talks/).

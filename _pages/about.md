I am a research associate at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Engineering where I work on the EPSRC funded [MURI project](http://vision.jhu.edu/infopursuit/) on "Semantic Information Pursuit for Multimodal Data Analysis". I am also a visiting researcher at The Alan Turing Institute, where I work on several projects for the [Data-Centric Engineering Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). Prior to this, I was a research assistant in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, and before that, a PhD student on the joint centre for doctoral training in Statistical Science led by the universities of Warwick and Oxford.

My current research interests are at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular, I work on methodology for statistical computation and inference for large scale and computationally expensive probabilistic models. To do so, I use a variety of tools including kernel methods, Monte Carlo methods, stochastic process theory and Stein's method. 

For more details on my research, see my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/papers/) page or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en). Alternatively, you can catch me at one of my [presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/). For supervision opportunities, see also [this page](https://fxbriol.github.io/supervision/).

### News

* My paper on "Probabilistic Integration: A Role in Statistical Computation?" has been accepted for [publication in Statistical Science](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056025) and will appear together with invited discussions from leading researchers in statistics, as well as a [rejoinder](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056029). There are three discussion pieces by (i) [Fred Hickernel and R. Jagadeeswaran](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056026), (ii) [Art Owen](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056027), and (iii) [Michael Stein and Ying Hung](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1555056028).

* I am co-organising a work at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) on ["Stein's method in Machine Learning and Statistics"](https://steinworkshop.github.io/) with Lester Mackey, Chris Oates, Qiang Liu and Larry Goldstein. The workshop will bring together experts in Stein's method and researchers in machine learning and statistics to explore applications of the method in those fields. The call for posters closes on the 17th May.

* New paper on approximating expensive and multimodal probability measures: [*Stein Point Markov Chain Monte Carlo*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03673). This paper significantly improves the scalability of the Stein Point algorithms, which were proposed as an alternative to MCMC methods for Bayesian computation for expensive posterior distributions. The paper will appear in the proceedings of ICML 2019.

About
======

I am currently a fourth year PhD student supervised by [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.girolami) and am part of a joint PhD program between the [Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/) and the [Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) called the Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme (OxWaSP). Since September 2016, I also have a visiting position in the Statistics Section at the [Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/) and at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

My interests are at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. 

My work focuses on probabilistic numerical methods. I am part of the 2017-2018 SAMSI working group on probabilistic numerics and organise regular virtual talks on the topic. You can also see the following page for a summary of some of my research.

More recently, I have also been working on Monte Carlo methods, with a special focus on applications of Stein's method and geometry to constructing control variates and Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers.

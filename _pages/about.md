I am currently a fourth year PhD student supervised by [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.girolami) and am part of a joint PhD program between the Department of Statistics at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/) and the Department of Statistics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) called the Oxford-Warwick Statistics Programme (OxWaSP). Since September 2016, I also have a visiting position in the Statistics Section at the Department of Mathematics at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/) and at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) as part of their programme on [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/programme-data-centric-engineering).

My main research interests are at the interface of Computational Statistics, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. In particular, I have been working on:

..* **Bayesian Probabilistic Numerical Methods**: I am interested in developing algorithms which solve problems from the field of numerical analysis using Bayesian inference methods. My work has focused particularly on Bayesian Quadrature, a method for numerical integration. As part of this interest, I am part of the [SAMSI Working Group on Probabilistic Numerics](http://oates.work/samsi/) and organise regular online talks on the topic.

..* **Monte Carlo Methods**: More recently, I have also been working on Monte Carlo methods, with a special focus on applications of Stein's method and geometry to constructing control variates and Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers.

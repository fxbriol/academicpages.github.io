I am a researcher at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/), where I am a member of the Statistics section in the Department of Mathematics. At Imperial, I work with [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.girolami) on the EPSRC funded [MURI project](http://vision.jhu.edu/infopursuit/) on "Semantic Information Pursuit for Multimodal Data Analysis". I am also a visiting researcher at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), where I work on projects relating to the [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering) programme with [Prof. Chris J. Oates](http://oates.work/). 

My current research interests are at the interface of Computational Statistics, Machine Learning and Applied Mathematics. In particular, I have been working on:

* **Bayesian Probabilistic Numerical Methods**: My work focuses on developing algorithms which solve problems from the field of Numerical Analysis using approaches from Bayesian inference. I have particularly focused on numerical integration, due to its importance in statistics and machine learning. See [this page](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) for recent work in probabilistic numerics, and [this page](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/probabilistic-numerics) for a non-technical overview.

* **Monte Carlo Methods**: I am interested in analysing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and variance reduction methods, specifically control variates and control functionals.

* **Stein's Method and Reproducing Kernels**: I have been working on the combination of [Stein's method](https://sites.google.com/site/steinsmethod/home) and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to construct algorithms for statistical computation and inference. This approach can be useful for a variety of problems, including control variates, approximation of measures and statistical estimators.

For more details on my research, see my [publications](https://fxbriol.github.io/papers/) page or my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=yLBYtAwAAAAJ&hl=en), or try to catch me at one of my [presentations](https://fxbriol.github.io/presentations/).

### News

* My paper on "Probabilistic Integration: A Role in Statistical Computation?" has been accepted for publication at Statistical Science and will appear together with invited discussions (all available [here](https://www.imstat.org/journals-and-publications/statistical-science/statistical-science-future-papers/)) from leading researchers in statistics, as well as a [rejoinder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10275).

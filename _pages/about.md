I am currently a researcher at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/), where I am a member of the statistics section in the department of mathematics. At Imperial, I work with [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.girolami) on the EPSRC funded [MURI project](http://vision.jhu.edu/infopursuit/) on "Semantic Information Pursuit for Multimodal Data Analysis". I am also a visiting researcher at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), where I work on projects relating to the [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/programme-data-centric-engineering) programme with [Dr. Chris J. Oates](http://oates.work/). 

My current research interests are at the interface of computational statistics, machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular, I have been working on:

* **Bayesian Probabilistic Numerical Methods**: My work focuses on developing algorithms which solve problems from the field of numerical analysis using approaches from Bayesian inference. I have particularly focused on numerical integration, due to its importance in statistics and machine learning.

* **Monte Carlo Methods**: I am interested in analysing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and variance reduction methods, specifically control variates and control functionals.

* **Stein's Method and Reproducing Kernels**: I have been working on the combination of [Stein's method](https://sites.google.com/site/steinsmethod/home) and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to construct algorithms for statistical computation and inference. This approach can be useful for a variety of problems, including control variates, approximation of measures and statistical estimators.

### News

1. I will be visiting [Lester Mackey](https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/) at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) in Cambridge (US) between the 22nd October 2018 and 16th November 2018. 

1. My paper on ["Probabilistic Integration: A Role in Statistical Computation?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00933) has been accepted for publication at [Statistical Science](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss) and will appear together with invited discussions from leading researchers in statistics.

1. I have two papers accepted at this year's edition of ICML; the first paper is on [*Stein Points*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10161), a method to efficiently sample from complex posteriors, and the second is on [Bayesian Quadrature for Multiple Related Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04153), an algorithm to compute the integral of several correlated functions simultaneously.
